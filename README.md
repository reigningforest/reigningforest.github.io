## About Me
- I am at Alexion, the Rare Disease Unit of AstraZeneca, as a Data Intern.
- I am a Machine Learning and Data Science graduate student at Northwestern University, expected to graduate in December 2025.
- I worked for 3 years at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) / Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) in Radiation Oncology research
- I have a Bachelor of Arts in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry from Middlebury College.


## Education
- MS in Machine Learning and Data Science - Northwestern University (GPA: 3.97)
- BA in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry - Middlebury College (magna cum laude, GPA: 3.64)


## Work Experience
### Real World Science Data Intern at Alexion, AstraZeneca
- Leveraging the power of LLMs to automate some manual, text heavy processes.

### Data Coordinator at BWH/DFCI
- Developed ETL workflows using R and Python to provide data efficiently to researchers, reducing data retrieval time from weeks to days.
- Conducted survival analyses using Cox Proportional Hazards models to assist physicians in research reports.
- Created a Python web scraper collecting 10,000+ facial images for ML model testing.


## Projects
### [Article Querying using RAG-based LLMs](https://github.com/reigningforest/rag_article_search)
- **Overview**: Used an Agentic AI structure to explore the interaction between RAG and LLMs in the context of Article searches.
- **Tools**: Python
- **Key Results**: While this does work, I hope to make queries more accurate in the future.

### [MLDS Hackathon 2024 - Soccer Analytics](https://github.com/reigningforest/CoxPH_Analysis_Simple)
- **Overview**: Participated in the program's annual 48 hour hackathon
- **Tools**: Python
- **Key Results**: Worked in a team of 4 to create initial lineup selection (random forest), player substitutions (collaborative filtering), and general recommendations (ChatGpt wrapper)

### [Video Game Analysis - In Progress](https://github.com/reigningforest/steam_analysis)
- **Overview**: Looking at trends in Steam's video game data
- **Tools**: Python
- **Key Results**: Currently working on this!

### [Celebrity Image Webscraper](https://github.com/reigningforest/Celebrity_Image_Scraper)
- **Overview**: Extracted Images from Wikimedia Commons
- **Tools**: Python
- **Key Results**: Assembled a database of images

### [Automated Cox Proportional Hazards Analysis](https://github.com/reigningforest/CoxPH_Analysis_Simple)
- **Overview**: Automated univariate and multivariate analysis Cox PH Analyses across covariates
- **Tools**: R
- **Key Results**: Used significant covariates from univariate analyses for multivariate analyses

### [R Data Manipulation Tutorial](https://github.com/reigningforest/R_data_tutorial)
- **Overview**: Provides an overview of R functions for data manipulation
- **Tools**: R
- **Key Results**: Was used to help coworkers who wanted to get better at working with data in their projects/studies
